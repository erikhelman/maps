# Udacity FSND Maps Project

This project is a map application that uses the Google and Foursquare APIs to display a list of locations in Tokyo. Markers are displayed on the map for each location provided and users can select the location via the marker or nav links on the side of the application. When a marker or location link is selected, the chosen marker will display an info window with a photo of that location, which is pulled from Foursquare.

The user can filter the list of locations and related markers via a text input above the location links. The user can also clear the filter to display all locations again.
